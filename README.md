# Getting started with Eclipse GEF – the Mindmap Tutorial

The [Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/) is a toolkit to create graphical Java applications either integrated in Eclipse or standalone. The most common use of the framework is to develop diagram editors, like a simple Mindmap editor we will create in the [GEF Mindmap Tutorial series](https://info.itemis.com/en/gef/tutorials/). Currently, the tutorial consists of 6 parts and all together 19 steps. They are structured as follows:
